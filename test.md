ALL ABOUT DOGS
This document is a poorly-written, bad example of a Markdown file. It covers different types of dogs, but the formatting is Terrible. You will see many bad practices, like inconsistent spacing, weird list formatting, and just bad style overall.

A Dog You MIGHT Know

The Labrador Retriever is a very popular dog. They are known for being friendly. This sentence has too many spaces after the period.  And here is a sentence that has inline code for no reason. They are often used as service animals.

Labs are smart.

They are great with kids.

And they love to swim, usually.

"A dog is a man's best friend."

Poodles and Such!/
Poodles are a different kind of dog. They have a Curly coat. There are three sizes of poodles, but we'll just talk about one:

Standard Poodle.

toy Poodle.

Miniature Poodle.

Here is a link to more information but it doesn't give you any context, so it's a BAD link. click here

this whole paragraph is inline code, which is wrong.

This is the end of the document, which ends with an excessive horizontal rule that serves no purpose.
