NETWORKING ON GOOGLE COMPUTE PLATFORM - A BAD DOC
So, you wanna do sum networking on Google Compute Platform (GCP)? Well, this here document is gonna tell ya how, but its gonna be real messy, cause thats what you asked for. Dont expect good grammar or rite product names, cause we ain't doin' that here. This is a very bad example, okay?

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Networks is Important

Every project on Google Compute Platform gets a VPC Network. Its like your own private network in the cloud, but its not really private, its just for you. You can make many subnets inside your VPC, like a bunch of little networks inside a bigger one. This is good for organizing stuff. But remember, the default network is always there, and its usually fine for most things. You can make custom mode networks too, if you want.

Firewall Rules, Ugh!

Firewall rules control what traffic can go in and out of your network. If you dont make rules, nothing works. Its super important to open ports for your apps. Like, if you got a web server, you gotta open port 80 and 443. This is how you do it, but its bad code:

gcloud compute firewall-rules create my-really-bad-rule --network default --allow tcp:80,443 --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0
this is some text that should not be in a code block.
it is very bad.

See? Thats how you do a firewall rule, but the code is not formatted good. And that text in there? Totally wrong for a code block.

Load Balancers and Other Stuff

Load balancers help your apps handle a lot of visitors. If you got a website, you use a load balancer to send traffic to all your web servers. This makes your app fast and keeps it from crashing. Google Compute Platform has different kinds of load balancers, like global ones for web traffic, and internal ones for stuff inside your network. They are very useful.

Other network things you might use:

Cloud DNS: For domain names, so people can find your website.

Cloud VPNs: To connect your office network to your Google Compute Platform network.

Cloud Interconnect: For super fast, dedicated connections, but only big companies need it.

Network Address Translation (NAT): This lets your VMs talk to the internet without public IPs.

This document is now ending. It was meant to be bad. Hope you learned what not to do./p
